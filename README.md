# CL-Diffusion

We introduce CL-Diffusion, a novel diffusion model for augmenting WiFi CSI data, thereby reducing data collection time and enhancing underground root tuber sensing (RTS) performance. Unlike previous diffusion models, CL-Diffusion explicitly
captures dependencies among correlated links through a tailored neural network. This design reduces deviations in the data generated for each link and ensures the generated samples closely align with the real data distribution. Specifically, we design a novel DNN for denoising in the diffusion process, with the architecture illustrated as follows.

Unlike previous diffusion models, CL-Diffusion explicitly captures dependencies among correlated links through a tailored neural network. This design reduces deviations in the data generated for each link and ensures the generated samples
closely align with the real data distribution. To evaluate the efficacy of CL-Diffusion, we use it to generate WiFi CSI data for the underground RTS application [1], and two RTS models are selected to assess the quality of data generated by CL-Diffusion. The following table presents the performance of CL-Diffusion compared with RF-Diffusion, used as the comparative model.
