# CL-Diffusion

We introduce CL-Diffusion, a novel diffusion model for augmenting WiFi CSI data, thereby reducing data collection time and enhancing underground root tuber sensing (RTS) performance. Unlike previous diffusion models, CL-Diffusion explicitly captures dependencies among correlated links through a tailored neural network. This design reduces deviations and ensures the generated samples closely align with the real data distribution. Specifically, we design a novel DNN for denoising in the diffusion process, with the architecture illustrated as follows.

We have released the pre-trained model and part of the corresponding data files in releases, which can be used for performance testing.

# Prerequisite and Evaluation
## 2.1 Prerequisite
CL-Diffusion is implemented with Python 3.10 and PyTorch 2.1.0. We manage the development environment using Conda. Execute the following commands to configure the development environment.
* Create a conda environment called RTS based on Python 3.10, and activate the environment.
```
conda create -n CL-Diffusion python=3.10
conda activate CL-Diffusion 
```
Install PyTorch
```
  pip install torch==2.1.0+cu121 torchvision==0.16.0+cu121 torchaudio==2.1.0+cu121 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```
Download or git clone the CL-Diffusion project. Download and unzip Models.zip and CSI_Samples_NoImpu.zip in releases to the project directory. 
```
   unzip Models.zip -d [CL-Diffusion root directory]
   unzip CSI_Samples_NoImpu.zip -d [CL-Diffusion root directory]
```
## 2.2 Evaluation for a static environment
To evaluate the efficacy of CL-Diffusion, we use it to generate WiFi CSI data for the underground RTS application [24], and two RTS models [27, 28] are selected to assess the quality of data generated by CL-Diffusion. The following table presents the performance of CL-Diffusion compared with RF-Diffusion [16], used as the comparative model.

Furthermore, we reduce the training dataset size to evaluate the robustness of CL-Diffusion. Specifically, we use only 40% of the collected CSI dataset to train RF-Diffusion and CL-Diffusion, and then combine these samples with augmented
data at varying ratios to train Swin-Trans [27]. The evaluation results are presented below.
