# CL-Diffusion

We introduce CL-Diffusion, a novel diffusion model for generating WiFi CSI data, thereby reducing data collection time and enhancing underground root tuber sensing performance. Unlike previous diffusion models, CL-Diffusion explicitly
captures dependencies among correlated links through a tailored neural network. This design reduces deviations in the data generated for each link and ensures the generated samples closely align with the real data distribution. Specifically, we design a novel DNN to perform denoising in the diffusion process.
